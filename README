1. Test Automation
Use “Robot Framework” as test automation framework to automate test without using automation recorders or code generators:

2. Coding
Write a program in any programming language that counts backwards from value provided by user to 1 and prints: “Agile”
if the number is divisible by 5, “Software” if the
number is divisible by 3, “Testing” if the number is divisible by both, or prints just the number if none of those cases
are true.
